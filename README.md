Project Description:
This project is a dynamic player squad filtering app for the “FC25 Team Squad,” themed around Liverpool Football Club for the 2024-2025 season. The application displays information about the team, including stats, head coach details, and a player roster. It allows users to interactively filter players based on their positions (forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeepers) or their status in the starting eleven.
Key Features:
1. Team Stats Display:
• Shows team name, sport type, season, and head coach details dynamically.
2. Player Roster Display:
• Lists all players, showing their name, position, number, starting status, and captain status.
• Includes player images for a visually engaging design.
3. Interactive Filters:
• A dropdown allows users to filter players by position or whether they are in the starting eleven.
4. Dynamic Card Rendering:
• Player data is rendered dynamically using JavaScript, ensuring the display updates based on user interaction.
5. Responsive Design:
• Adjusts layout for different screen sizes (e.g., mobile and desktop).
Languages and Technologies Used:
1. HTML:
• Structures the content, including the player cards, dropdown menu, and team stats.
2. CSS:
• Provides the visual design, using custom colors (e.g., Liverpool’s red and gold) and styles for responsiveness.
• Uses flexbox for layout and media queries for adaptability.
3. JavaScript:
• Powers the interactivity:
• Dynamically renders player data from a structured JavaScript object.
• Implements filtering functionality for the dropdown menu.
• Utilizes the Object.freeze method to prevent data modification.
4. JSON-like Object for Data Management:
• Stores player details, coach information, and team stats.
5. Responsive Design Techniques:
• Ensures compatibility across devices with varying screen sizes using media queries.
What Does It Do?
The project provides an interactive platform for exploring a soccer team’s roster. Users can:
• View all players with key stats like position, number, captain status, and whether they are part of the starting eleven.
• Filter the roster to focus on specific groups of players (e.g., midfielders or starting players).
• Navigate a visually appealing interface that highlights Liverpool’s brand identity.
This project is an excellent example of integrating dynamic data rendering and user interactivity with a clean design. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and responsive web app.
